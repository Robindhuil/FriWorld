# FriWorld

## Description
This project is an interactive 3D application created in **Unity**, providing a virtual tour of the Faculty of Management Science and Informatics (FRI) at the University of Å½ilina.  
The goal is to present the faculty in an attractive way to elementary and high school students through real-time movement, interactive elements such as **quizzes, information panels, animations, and mini-games**.  
The application serves as a tool to support the faculty's recruitment activities.  

**Keywords:** 3D presentation, Unity, interactivity, virtual tour, educational application, school visualization, real-time movement.  

_(This project was developed as a bachelor thesis in 2025.)_
