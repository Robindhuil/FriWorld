# FriWorld

## Description
This project is an interactive 3D application created in **Unity**, providing a virtual tour of the Faculty of Management Science and Informatics (FRI) at the University of Žilina.  
The goal is to present the faculty in an attractive way to elementary and high school students through real-time movement, interactive elements such as **quizzes, information panels, animations, and mini-games**.  
The application serves as a tool to support the faculty's recruitment activities.  

**Keywords:** 3D presentation, Unity, interactivity, virtual tour, educational application, school visualization, real-time movement.  

_(This project was developed as a bachelor thesis in 2025.)_
